# appu .files
My dotfiles for me to recover incase of Distro-hopping, reinstalling or if im changing PCs.. 
(Feel free to use it if you want lol)

I guess i'll just git clone it or something when i want to install the dotfiles..
I could've copied and pasted my /home directory but i dont have a storage option big enough to fit my entire /home directory + it'd probably cause some mismatch of versions between apps which is just gonna make my life suckkkkkkk. So, yeah.. thats why this exists.

Dont open issues or PRs, this isnt a regular git repo and i'll laugh at you and close them.
